# Slack to OpenAI Gateway

This Ruby code packaged as a serverless AWS SAM app serves as a bridge between Slack and the OpenAI API, allowing a group of users to interact with GPT-4 via a shared Slack channel. This opens up exciting possibilities for collaborative conversations with AI in a group setting.

## Overview

The application is based on AWS Lambda and is triggered by events from the Slack Events API. This means that whenever a user posts a message in the linked Slack channel, an event is sent to our Lambda function, which processes the event and sends a response back to the Slack channel. The core processing logic is encapsulated in a Ruby class called `SlackEventsAPIHandler`.

```mermaid

    A[Slack User] -- Sends Message --> B((Slack API))
    B -- Triggers Event --> C{AWS Lambda}
    C -- Executes --> D[SlackEventsAPIHandler]
    D -- Sends Request --> E{OpenAI API}
    E -- Returns Response --> D
    D -- Sends Response --> B
    B -- Posts Response --> A
```

The `SlackEventsAPIHandler` class is responsible for parsing incoming Slack events, dispatching them to the correct handler based on their type, and returning the appropriate response. Currently, it supports two types of events: `url_verification` and `message`.

The `url_verification` event is used by Slack to confirm that our endpoint is operational and owned by us. When this event type is received, the class simply echoes back the 'challenge' string provided in the event.

The `message` event type is triggered whenever a message is posted in the Slack channel. When this event type is received, the class logs the message text and sends a response back to the Slack channel. Currently, the response is simply a mirror of the original message, but the plan is to replace this with a call to the OpenAI API, so the response will be generated by GPT-4.

## Update

We have now implemented basic interaction with the OpenAI API. A separate GPT class has been created to process Slack conversation history into OpenAI chat message lists and to send the OpenAI API requests.

## Architecture

This project is a serverless application based on the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). It uses AWS Lambda for running the application code in response to events, such as a new message in the Slack channel.

## Configuration

The application is configured to run in different environments (e.g., development, production) using environment variables and parameters stored in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store. The parameters are fetched at runtime and include the Slack App ID and Access Token.

## Testing

The code includes a comprehensive suite of RSpec tests to ensure that it handles Slack events correctly. These tests cover the main event dispatching logic, as well as the individual handlers for the supported event types.

## Future Work

The next step is to integrate the OpenAI API so that the responses to Slack messages are generated by GPT-4. This will involve adding a new method to the `SlackEventsAPIHandler` class to make the API call, and modifying the `message` method to use this new method.
